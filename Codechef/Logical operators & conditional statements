// Solution as follows
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

    cin >> t;

    {

        cin >> N >> A >> B;

            cout << "N is divisible by A and B" << endl;
        else if (N % A == 0)
            cout << "N is divisible by only A" << endl;
        else if (N % B == 0)
            cout << "N is divisible by only B" << endl;
        // The last statement could have been an 'else' statement
        // else if condition used to show usage of 'and' statement
        else if (N % A != 0 && N % B != 0)
            cout << "N is divisible by neither A nor B" << endl;
