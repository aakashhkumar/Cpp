#include <iostream>: This line is including the contents of the iostream library. This library is necessary for input and output operations in C++. Think of it like giving your program the ability to speak and listen.

using namespace std;: C++ has something called 'namespaces' which are used to organize code into logical groups. By stating using namespace std;, you're telling the program that you'll be using functions from std (standard) namespace.

int main() { ... }: This is the main function. Every C++ program must have a main function. This is the starting point of your program. When you run the program, the code inside the main function is what gets executed.


This code, when run, will simply display 19 on the screen, which is the sum of 69 and 96.

Curly Braces {}: The opening curly brace { after main() indicate the start of main function. The closing cury braces } indicate the end of main function block.
